The Eclipse Dynamic Languages Toolkit (DLTK) is a tool for vendors, researchers, and end-users who rely on dynamic languages. DLTK is comprised of a set of extensible frameworks designed to reduce the complexity of building full featured development environments for dynamic languages such as PHP and Perl. Besides a set of frameworks DLTK provides exemplary Tcl, Ruby, and Python Integrated Development Environments ready to use out of the box.
